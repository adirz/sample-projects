FILES:
README			- This file
Makefile		- Makefile to create the program
Cache.cpp		- What represent the cache and blocks
CachingFileSystem.cpp	- The main file to run the program
Logger.cpp		- What responsible to write the log

ANSWERS:
1.	yes. the heap is saved on the memory and when we access the disk we need to first put it in
	the memory so it saves us a step.
2.	There is no one answer- the first one is faster to use blocks already in the cache, the
	second one is faster to add new blocks to the cache.
3.	Because in the more sophisticated algorythems are needed to be managed externally (LRU by
	the proccessor) and are terminated and called by the clock. In the other hand, in our LFU
	implementation we access the memory and the file block at the same place.
4.	LRU better: runing a program that access the last x blocks and writing sometyhing to a new block
	LFU better: reading some blocks a lot and some change always
	none help: always reading new blocks (e.g.: playing a movie)
5.	The ideal block size is 4k- because its our minimal reading size of files
