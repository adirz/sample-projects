1.it was hard to understand  how all the modules works together and how to work with “net”(is was unfamiliar to us).
the debugging part was hard too, we needed to do a lot of printings.

2.the fun part was when it worked and we saw Putin ;)

3.we did everything asynchronously.

4.we were testing  our work in steps by printing the results of the header and the errors (in the process).in the end we checked it by text. js and load.js. we send “http” requests and  compare: the body we get in the respond to the body of our files, the errors- like 404 (with wrong address)and that we don’t have excess to the folders  before the root folder.
also we send a lot of request in load.js to see  if the result is as expected.
