PART 2
======

1. 

RR:
Pro: Starvation free - there in no thread that remains pending for a long time.
Con: The programmer has less freedom in schedualing management.

PQ:
Pro: More urgent preccesses will finish their run faster.
Con: It may take very long time for some proccesses to start running.

In our combined policy, on one hand the user can decide the priorities of the proccesses, so that the
more urgent ones will finish faster, and on the other hand within the queue of each priority there is no
starvation. 

2.

For example, a request to open a certain file - while the OS opens the file, the proccess will be blocked.
