how to run everything:

1) put the entire AI folder in "/tmp".
2) chmod to allow read and write to anything in the folder: chmod -R +777 /tmp/AI
3) go to /tmp/AI/Optimization
4) 

A)
change args.txt to the wanted command
if you want to create a best grading system:
<kidsInGeneration>
<generationNum>
<optimizationType>
<printing>
<botType>
where kidsInGeneration and generationNum are ints, optimizationType is "genetic"/"stoHillClimb",
printing is "true"/"false", botType is "UserBot"/"HeuristicBot"
be prepared- it takes a lot of time- about two-three minutes per game, number of games is kidsInGeneration*(kidsInGeneration - 1)*2*generationNum

B)
if you want to test a lot of best agents against each other after you run the optimization:
each time you run A) it will end by saving the best grading of that configuration to "/tmp/AI/results/best.json"
remove the last line indicating how many generation has past (as it saves the best on each generation on the same spot,
so it is an indicator to where we are) and save it in the fitting folder ("highPopAnnHeubot"/"highPopAnnUserbot"/...) as "0.json"/"1.json"
change args.txt to "Test"

5) go to "/tmp/AI/Optimization" and run in the shell "./gradlew clean run" and it will run A) or B) by what you did in 4)
6) if you want to see the matches being played, go on your browser into "localhost:8080"
