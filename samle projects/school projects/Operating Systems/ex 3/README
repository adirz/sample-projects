FILES:
README	 	- This file.
Block.cpp	- Class for each block, in the chain
MinHeap.cpp	- A data structure to save the minimal unused number.
blockchain.cpp	- An implementation of the given blockchain. to library

ANSWERS:
1.	because we don't syncornize the block attachments, when added, the same block can have mant kids,
	until a new attach is made. the faster the attachment is made, the fewer blocks attach to each one,
	because the chain got longer so they would attach to a different, higher, bllock.

2.	If at each attachment we would attach it to the longest, and not to his original father.

3.	In case two people initilialize the library at the same time, we didn't specified how to manage it.
	Although, it is unlikley, we used mutex to make it safe.
