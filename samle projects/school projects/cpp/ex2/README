I did the bonuses of finding the tie situations (a player can't move) and you can escape loosing in
any legal mean possible.
Both bonuses ware done by going on all the player's pieces and checking either they can move to any
location in the board without exposing the king. Where if you are under threat for the king and
can't move without him being exposed you lost for sure.
