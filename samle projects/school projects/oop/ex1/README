Design:

I used a class I created called Statistics, to help me keep track of the stats.
The main program Is in a loop that goes on until the variable gameContinue 
changes to false. In the loop, if the user wishes to, or it is needed, he can 
set the settings. after the user guesses I check the bulls and cows (not the
most efficient way, but data structures were not allowed). The way they are
checked is by first matching each place in the guess with it equivlant to
check for bulls, than counting the cows in a similar matter, and than
subtructing those we counted twice.
