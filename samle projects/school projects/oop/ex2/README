MathTerm.java-
Class represent the core of the math term.

SimpleMathTerm.java-
Class represent the math term, with precision and implementation of toLatex

SumMathTerm.java-
Class represent a sum of an expression which can be changed.

BinaryMathTerm.java-
Class holds two MathTerms.

BracketsMathTerm.java-
Class represent a math term with brackets

SimpleBinaryOpMathTerm.java-
Class represent two simple math terms whith a notation between them.

FractionMathTerm.java-
Class represent the division of two Terms



Design:

I had little design power, since it almost completly was set by the rules
given in the assignment. However:

MathTerm:
Up in the hierarchy of every other class. Holds The basic vars (exponent,
isBarred, isNegated) and functions as told.

SimpleMathTerm:
Derives from MathTerm class. Have vars (numeric, num, precisionDigits,
setPrecision, term), and function as told, implement toLatex.

SumMathTerm:
Derives from MathTerm.

BinaryMathTerm:
Derives from MathTerm.

BracketsMathTerm:
Derives from MathTerm.

SimpleBinaryOpMathTerm:
Derives from BinaryMathTerm. If the sign is "*" it adds "\cdot", otherwise it
adds the sign.

FractionMathTerm:
Derives from BinaryMathTerm.


Implementation Issues:

None

Answers to Questions:
1. It will derive from MathTerm, upon build it will recive a meth term and add
"\int_"+a+"^"+b+" \!" + the latex of it+ "\mathrm{d}"+x. where a,b,x are also
required.
